Air quality in American cities is an environmental subject that always receives special attention from environmentalists. Recognizing the distribution rules by area and width of this object will help the government and urban managers. In addition, based on the experience of experts, the use of mathematical models (specifically linear regression and Kriging interpolation methods) to determine the spatial distribution rules of environmental objects is being developed. growing strongly in the world. However, to date, these methods have not been widely used in the fields of weather forecasting and quality of life in the US. In order to introduce the applicability of the linear regression method and the Kriging interpolation method, the following report presents the results obtained when using these methods to survey the distribution rules of air quality. based on different measurement indicators in American cities. In addition, the interpolation results are also compared with previous results and direct field survey results, thereby evaluating the reliability of the interpolation results.
